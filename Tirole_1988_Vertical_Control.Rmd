# Summary of the Paper

（ひとことメモ）



# 4.1 Linear Prices versus Vertical Restraints

## 4.1.1 Basic Framework

- A single supplier, called the _monopolist_ or the _manufacturer_, produces an intermediate good at a constant unit cost $c$.
- He is the only producer of this good.
- He sells it to a single downstream firm, called the _retailer_.
- The retailer resells the product.
